    paragraph1: "From a young age, I was connected to the world of aesthetics and image, starting my career as a model. Over the years, I worked on various reality television shows in South America and developed my professional career as a model in South America, Central America, North America, and Europe, which allowed me to understand firsthand the importance of physical care, discipline, and healthy habits.",
    paragraph2: "From that experience, my genuine interest in fitness and nutrition was born. Initially, I began helping friends and family improve their physical condition and appearance as a hobby, and I discovered how good it felt to see the positive changes they achieved in their bodies, their health, and their self-esteem.",
